yas--table (:constructor yas--make-snippet-table (name)))
  "A table to store snippets for a particular mode.

Has the following fields:

`yas--table-name'

  A symbol name normally corresponding to a major mode, but can
  also be a pseudo major-mode to be used in
  `yas-activate-extra-mode', for example.

`yas--table-hash'

  A hash table (KEY . NAMEHASH), known as the \"keyhash\". KEY is
  a string or a vector, where the former is the snippet's trigger
  and the latter means it's a direct keybinding. NAMEHASH is yet
  another hash of (NAME . TEMPLATE) where NAME is the snippet's
  name and TEMPLATE is a `yas--template' object.

`yas--table-direct-keymap'

  A keymap for the snippets in this table that have direct
  keybindings. This is kept in sync with the keyhash, i.e., all
  the elements of the keyhash that are vectors appear here as
  bindings to `yas-maybe-expand-from-keymap'.

`yas--table-uuidhash'

  A hash table mapping snippets uuid's to the same `yas--template'
  objects. A snippet uuid defaults to the snippet's name."

之前我那个hack, 似乎可以用下面这个
yas-skip-and-clear-or-delete-char (&optional field)
  "Clears unmodified field if at field start, skips to next tab.

Otherwise deletes a character normally by calling `delete-char'."


yas--skip-and-clear (field &optional from)
  "Deletes the region of FIELD and sets it's modified state to t.
If given, FROM indicates position to start at instead of FIELD's beginning."
  ;; Just before skipping-and-clearing the field, mark its children
  ;; fields as modified, too. If the children have mirrors-in-fields
  ;; this prevents them from updating erroneously (we're skipping and
  ;; deleting!).

嵌套结束, 外层 mark 报错
